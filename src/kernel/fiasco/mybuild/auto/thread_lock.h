/** Thread lock.
    This lock uses the basic priority-inheritance mechanism (Switch_lock)
    and extends it in two ways: First, it has a hinting mechanism that
    allows a locker to specify whether the clear() operation should
    switch to the thread that was locked.  Second, it maintains the current
    locker for Context; this locker automatically gets CPU time allocated
    to the locked thread (Context's ``donatee''); 
    Context::switch_exec() uses that hint.
    To make clear, which stuff in the TCB the lock not protects:
    -the thread state
    -queues
    -the raw kernelstack
    The rest is protected with this lock, this includes the
    kernelstackpointer (kernel_sp).
