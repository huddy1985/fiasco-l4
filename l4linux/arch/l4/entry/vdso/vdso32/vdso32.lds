 * You should add __init immediately before the function name, like:

 * If the function has a prototype somewhere, you can also add

 *
 * extern int initialize_foobar_device(int, int, int) __init;
 *
 * For initialized data:
 * You should insert __initdata or __initconst between the variable name
 * and equal sign followed by value, e.g.:
 *
 * static int init_variable __initdata = 0;
 * static const char linux_logo[] __initconst = { 0x32, 0x36, ... };
 *
 * Don't forget to initialize data not at file scope, i.e. within a function,
